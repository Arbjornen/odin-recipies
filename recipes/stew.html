  <h1>Westfew Stew</h1>
  
  <img src="../images/stew.jpg" alt="A bowl of soup next to a glass of wine and a lit candle.">

  <h3>This nourishing stew has been made many different ways over the years. In lean times, with the people of Westfall under attack by bandits and gnoll raiders, murloc eyes and buzzard meat were commonly used. We would not recommend it.</h3>
  
  <p>A hearty stew made by Salma Saldean as a reward for any adventurers of Westfall willing to lend her their aid. - A recipe from the World Of Warcraft.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>2 pounds quality stew beef, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
    <li>1 cup diced bacon</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
    <li>1 pound button mushrooms, sliced</li>
    <li>1 cups peeled pearl onions</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
    <li>quarter cup flour</li>
    <li>4 cups beef broth</li>
    <li>2 cups red wine</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon northern spices</li>
    <li>6 carrots, peeled and cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
    <li>1 garlic head, cloves separated and peeled</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh parley</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>

  <ol>

    <li>Preheat the oven to 475°F. Toss the beef with the salt and allow to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>

    <li>Scatter the bacon in a 9 × 12-inch baking pan with tall sides, along with 1 tablespoon butter, and cook for about 15 minutes, until the fat has rendered out.</li>

    <li> Cook this for about 15 minutes until the liquid released by the mushrooms has mostly evaporated and the onions are slightly glazed. Remove to a bowl and set aside until the stew is nearly finished.</li>
  
    <li>Reduce oven temperature to 325°F. Gradually add the flour to the hot pan with the bacon and bacon fat, whisking until there is no more flour visible. Gradually whisk in the broth, half the red wine, and the spices.</li>
    
    <li>Layer the carrots, garlic, barley, and bay leaves in the pan with the broth, then lay the stew meat over top of that. Pour in enough water to come most of the way up the meat, but not cover it.</li>
   
  </ol>
