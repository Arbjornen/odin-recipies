  <img src="../images/steak.jpg" alt="A plate of cooked steak, potatoes and vegetables.">

  <h3>Think of a cross between a boar and a stag, and you’ve got yourself a shoveltusk. This steak is beloved by magic users, who claim it gives them just a little bit of an edge in casting their spells. Don’t ask us how.</h3>

  <p>A hearty meal for adventurers exploring across the frozen lands of Northrend - A recipe from the World Of Warcraft.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>2 steaks, about 1 pound each, at room temperature</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 to 2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon northern spices</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 cup red wine</li>
  </ul>
 
  <h2>Steps</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Melt the olive oil and butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Mix together the salt, Northern Spices, and garlic in a small bowl, then liberally cover both sides of the steaks with the seasoning.</li>
    <li>Lower the steaks into the pan and sear for a minute or two. Flip and cook for another minute or two, then carefully add the wine. The pan will hiss and spatter for a moment.</li>
    <li>Cook for a few more minutes for medium-rare steaks. When the meat is done to your liking, remove to a cutting board, cover loosely with foil, and allow the steaks to rest while you finish the sauce.</li>
    <li>Reduce the liquid in the pan until it has thickened somewhat but is still pourable, roughly 10 minutes.</li>
  </ol>
