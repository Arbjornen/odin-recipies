  <h1>Dragons Breath Chili</h1>

  <img src="../images/chili.jpg" alt="A big bowl of chili.">

  <h3>While this chili is unlikely to make you breathe flames, it lives up to its name in all other ways. Thick and flavorful, with just enough of a bite to satisfy, it is a hearty dish popular with melee types, who credit it with giving them a fighting edge before important battles. </h3>

  <p>The original recipe comes from the swampland of Dustwallow Marsh in Kalimdor, but this version is a little different. No dragons were harmed in making it. - A recipe from the World Of Warcraft.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 chili pepper, minced</li>     
    <li>1 dried chipotle pepper, diced</li>
    <li>half an onion, diced</li>
    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
    <li>1 pound chuck steak</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
    <li>One 6-ounce can tomato paste</li>
    <li>One 12-ounce bottle beer</li>
    <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
    <li>Two 15-ounce cans of chili beans</li>
    <li>Two 28-ounce cans diced fire-roasted tomatoes</li>
    <li>Grated cheddar cheese for topping</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>

  <ol>
      <li>Add the oil to a large stockpot over medium heat. Add the peppers and the onion, then cook for about 5 minutes, or until brown and soft.</li>

      <li>Add the ground beef, sausage, and chuck steak, stirring until all the meat is browned, another 5 minutes or so.</li>

      <li>Add all the spices, followed by the tomato paste, and stir so the paste and spices are evenly distributed. Pour in the beer and the beef broth, then add the beans and diced tomatoes.</li>

      <li>Lower the heat to a simmer and cook, uncovered, for about 2 hours, until the chili has thickened somewhat. Scoop into bowls and top with cheese.</li>
